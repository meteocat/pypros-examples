    "\n",
    "If you want to run PyPros form terminal directly, you can use ```pypros_run``` script. Now we'll how it must be called.\n",
    "\n",
    "```pypros_run``` receives up to six arguments, since two of them are optional. The arguments and their order are the following ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Order | Argument      | Description                            | Mandatory   |\n",
    "|-------|---------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|\n",
    "| 1     | tair          | Air temperature field file path        | &#9745;     |\n",
    "| 2     | tdew          | Dew point temperature field file path  | &#9745;     |\n",
    "| 3     | config_file   | Configuration file path                | &#9745;     |\n",
    "| 4     | out_file      | Digital Elevation Model file path      | &#9745;     |\n",
    "| 5     | dem           | Digital Elevation Model file path      | &#9744;     |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration file is a .json including the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "    {\n",
    "     \"method\": \"static_tw\",\n",
    "     \"threshold\": 1.0,\n",
    "     \"data_format\": {\"vars_files\": [\"tair\", \"tdew\", \"dem\"]},\n",
    "     \"refl_masked\": \"True\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the pypros_run script configuration parameters, see [PyPros Class](pypros_class.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to execute the script you must have pyPROS package installed, see Documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A configuration file and sample fields for air temperature, dew point temperature, digital elevation model and radar reflectivity are available in ```../sample-data/``` directory. We'll introduce two examples of how ```pypros_run``` script is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Air temperature static threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration file must look like the following one. We'll set the threshold to 1.0$^{\\circ}C.\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "    {\n",
    "     \"method\": \"static_ta\",\n",
    "     \"threshold\": 1.0,\n",
    "     \"data_format\": {\"vars_files\": [\"tair\", \"tdew\"]},\n",
    "     \"refl_masked\": \"False\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we set ```refl_masked``` to ```False``` we do not have to import any radar reflectivity field. We would execute the script this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "> pypros_run [path to air temperature field] [path to dew point temperature field] [path to configuration file] [output path]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wet bulb temperature threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration file should include the following parameters. We'll set the threshold to 1.5$^{\\circ}C.\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "    {\n",
    "     \"method\": \"static_tw\",\n",
    "     \"threshold\": 1.5,\n",
    "     \"data_format\": {\"vars_files\": [\"tair\", \"tdew\", \"dem\"]},\n",
    "     \"refl_masked\": \"True\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we set ```refl_masked``` to ```True``` we have to include the radar reflectivity field in ```data_format``` and as an script argument. In addition, we have also included ```dem``` in order to take into account altitude when calculating wet bulb temperature. We would execute the script this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "> pypros_run [path to air temperature field] [path to dew point temperature field] [path to configuration file] [output path] --dem [path to dem] --refl [path to radar reflectivity file]\n",
